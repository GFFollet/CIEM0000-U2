Latex notes for Interdiciplinary mechanics CIEM0000 U2 TU Delft Q1
Feel free to fix any mistake or add content, just make sure to add yourself to list of contributors in the first page. The setup is very rudimentary, as you must manually add yourself to the list of contributor on the second page, and manualy change the version, might change this if I have time.
Ill review/approve the commits one/twice a semester.

Please make a new branch for every new version of the course (every year).

Any question/suggestion let me know

PS. I might grantadmin access/ownership to UBASE if people actually use this repo.

For problems with reference [?], compile with pdflatex, then Bibtex the pdflatex again.
Similar to toc, compile pdflatex twice to add toc
